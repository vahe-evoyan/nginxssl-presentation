# Problems

* SSL/TLS uses "ancient cryptography algorithms"
* Many of these algorithms have known flaws 
  - or used in ways known to be unsafe
* Why? Backward compatibility!

note:
 - backward compatibility - mostly
 - lazy programmers not re-implementing algorithms, but patching them
 - we're gonna fight with it
